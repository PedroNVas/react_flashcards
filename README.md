# Flashcards Project

This project is related to the third assessment from Udacity's React Nanodegree Program.

## Getting Start

### Back-End

This project expects to have a `api-server` runnig. Since the source code was provided to develop the application,
I have assumed that the server should be running locally. You can clone the repository in [here](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter).

All the REST API endpoints can be found in a README.md inside the repository.

### Requisites

This project was built using `yarn`, so it is advised to use it instead of yarn.

* Npm is distributes with Node.js, so just download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 

### Installing and Running

```
git clone https://github.com/PedroNigrisVasconcellos/react-flashcards.git
cd react-flashcards

yarn install
yarn start
```

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app). 

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

For details, check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
